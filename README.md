# Swagger Profile

A firefox and chrome extension that will help you manage different bearer token profile for swagger.

# Objectives/Challenges
I want to try different things for this project. As I've never started react, webpack, eslint, typescript and testing from scratch this project will be about these also.
1. The main objective I want an extension that I will be able to manage my different swagger tokens (admin, client, manager, developer etc) with.
2. The extension should support both **firefox** and **chrome**.
3. Build the extension with basic html, bootstrap and js
4. Integrate **react** with the project.
5. Integrate and configure **webpack** for the build process 
6. Integrate and configure **eslint**.
